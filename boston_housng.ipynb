You will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions for this project. Unless it is requested, do not modify any of the code that has already been included. In this template code, there are four sections which you must complete to successfully produce a prediction with your model. Each section where you will write code is preceded by a **STEP X** header with comments describing what must be done. Please read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions.  \n",

In such cases MSE is a more appropriate measure of error and hence I chose MSE.Also only MSE and MAE can be used for our model as only they support continuos multi output data.The rest of the metrics that are:-accuracy,precision,recall and F1 score are not suitable for continuos multioutput data"

    "**Answer: **In the context of machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or model selection is the problem of choosing a set of hyperparameters for a learning algorithm, usually with the goal of optimizing a measure of the algorithm's performance on an independent data set.The traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been grid search, or a parameter sweep, which is simply an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It unfortunately suffers from the curse of dimesionality so,it can only be used when we have not very high dimensional data.\n",
    "With a gridsearch you just try a set of values for your parameters and look at which value the objective function is largest (or smallest). Lets say you have one parameter and want to try for the values $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$. (this is not realistic, normally you try many more possible values). In this example you need to compute the objective function 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say there is a second parameter. Now you need to try the values: \n",
    "\n",
    "$(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2, 5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (2,10), \\cdots , (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now you need to compute the objective function $10 \\times 10 = 100$ times. If you have a third parameter you would end up with $10^3=1000$ evaluations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a more realist number of tries per parameter, say 1000, then we end up with a $1000^1=1000$ evaluations for one parameter, $1000^2=1,000,000$ evaluations for two parameters, $1000^3=1,000,000,000$ evaluations for three parameters, etc. You can see that you can quickly end up with an unmanageable number of evaluations."

    "**Answer: **Cross-validation is a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is performed as given->>One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set)-->>\"validating the analysis on the other subset\" means that the model is valid if it has error less then a certain chosen threshold and thus when it is below that threshold,it means that it is able to predict within an acceptable margin of errors. To reduce variability, multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are averaged over the rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation helps to estimate the generalization performance of a model built using the grid search.\n",
    "Cross-validation is when you reserve part of your data to use in evaluating your model. There are different cross-validation methods. The simplest conceptually is to just take 70% (just making up a number here, it doesn't have to be 70%) of your data and use that for training, and then use the remaining 30% of the data to evaluate the model's performance. The reason you need different data for training and evaluating the model is to protect against overfitting. There are other (slightly more involved) cross-validation techniques, of course, like k-fold cross-validation, which often used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search means you have a set of models (which differ from each other in their parameter values, which lie on a grid). What you do is you then train each of the models and evaluate it using cross-validation. You then select the one that performed best.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example, if you're using a support vector machine, you could use different values for gamma and C. So, for example you could have a grid with the following values for (gamma, C): (1, 1), (0.1, 1), (1, 10), (0.1, 10). It's a grid because it's like a product of [1, 0.1] for gamma and [1, 10] for C. Grid-search would basically train a SVM for each of these four pair of (gamma, C) values, then evaluate it using cross-validation, and select the one that did best."

    "# Model Prediction\n",
    "In this final section of the project, you will make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`. When applying grid search along with cross-validation to optimize your model, it would typically be performed and validated on a training set and subsequently evaluated on a **dedicated test set**. In this project, the optimization below is performed on the *entire dataset* (as opposed to the training set you made above) due to the many outliers in the data. Using the entire dataset for training provides for a less volatile prediction at the expense of not testing your model's performance. \n",
